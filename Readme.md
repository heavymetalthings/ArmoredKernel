## ArmoredCAD 

Welcome to this massive, utopian, yet beautiful project.

Our aim is to provide a viable aternative to the other geometric kernels.

While there are FOSS alternatives to proprietary softwares like Freecad, they are often sketchy and extremely frustrating to use.

Since open software is the only way to go, we wish to compete with kernels like ACIS.

Our code is aimed to be reliable while keeping it fast. The quite young Rust language is by far one of the best choices, because, it has young blood compared to C/C++ and is faster than python.

For beginners, it seems very complicated to switch to rust, but, hey, why not? You only get old when you stop learning 

## Armored Kernel

The geometric kernel is there to provide 

## Parts

The parts functionality is there to provide all the tools to model unique parts.

### Modelling



## Blueprints

Once parts are created/imported, they can be set on paper.

The 

## Assemblies

The assemblies functionality is there to provide the possibility to work with assemblies of courses, but will also provide other tools like finite elements, or cinematic simulation.

### Assembly (core)

Main assembly functions : 

### FEA

### Animation

Should provide a way to play and with associated parameters, output moves.

## Author's note

Here lay all my hopes for humanity to strive its best form, because I truly believe in open source so much that without it, I wouldn't even want to wake up tomorrow.
Making open source hard and software are my main motives in life and they are what makes great people in my opinion. No matter how impressive your project is, it is not worth the effort if you keep it for yourself.

Stupid people will always tell you to do something else before doing what you truly want. 
Ignore those people, because in the end, you'll be different, will think different, and someday, maybe you'll make something great for the community.

I hope those words will inspire someone, and that this software will become a free standard. 

To the companies who will want to buy it, for profit, I will say no at any cost.

This software will never become closed, nor get spyware.
