## ArmoredCAD 

Welcome to this massive, humongous project.

Our aim is to provide a viable aternative to the other geometric kernels.

While there are FOSS alternatives to proprietary softwares like Freecad, they are often sketchy and extremely frustrating to use.

## Author's note

Here lay all my hopes for humanity to strive its best form, because I truly believe in open source so much that without it, I wouldn't even want to wake up tomorrow.
Making open source hard and software are my main motives in life and they are what makes great people in my opinion. No matter how impressive your project is, it is not worth the effort if you keep it for yourself.

Stupid people will always tell you to do something else before doing what you truly want. 
Ignore those people, because in the end, you'll be different, will think different, and someday, maybe you'll make something great for the community.

I hope those words will inspire someone, and that this software will become a free standard. 

To the companies who will want to buy it, for profit, I will say no at any cost.

This software will never become closed, nor get spyware.
